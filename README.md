# Machine Learning Unsupervised Learning - US Arrests Project

This data set contains statistics, in arrests per 100,000 residents for assault, murder, and rape in each of the 50 US states in 1973. Also given is the percent of the population living in urban areas.

In this project, using unsupervised learning, the aim is to understand if there are any dependencies between cities and arrests data. 

Unsupervised learning is a statistical technique for exploring and discovering knowledge, from a multivariate data, without building a predictive models. It helps to visualise the relationship between variables, as well as, to identify groups of similar observations.

### Table of contents

1. Exploratory Data Analysis - EDA
2. Principal Component Analysis - PCA
3. Cluster Analysis
4. Conclusion

### Install
This project requires Python, and the following libraries installed:

- NumPy
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- scikit-learn
- sciPy

You will also need to have an IDE to run and execute Jupyter Notebook.

### Code

- The code containing the model training is provided in the 'us_arrest.ipynb' notebook file. 
- You will be required to include the 'UsArrests.csv files to execute the code.

## Conclusion

The cluster analysis has helped us to categorize cities level of danger as well as identify a relationship between city size and general violent crime.

In this analysis of US Arrests dataset done with Unsupervised Learning using Principal Component Analysis, K-Means Clustering and Hierarchical Clustering, we can conclude that Mississippi, North Carolina, South Carolina have high Urban Population and high Crime rates. Whereas states like North Dakota, South Dakota, Vermont have low Urban Population and low Crime rates.
